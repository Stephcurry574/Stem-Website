    <p class="h1">Vegan Samosa</p>
    <p>Preparation
1. Peel, halve and boil 500 grams (3 to 4 medium) potatoes in a pot of water, until fork tender (not mushy). Or pressure cook unpeeled and halved potatoes for 2 to 3 whistles on a medium flame or in the instant pot for 5 mins, placed over a trivet with 1 cup water. Peel them after cooling.
<br><br>
Tip: You can also pressure-cook them whole following these timings – small potatoes – 5 mins, medium size – 7 mins and large – 10 mins.
<br><br>

2. Cool the potatoes and crumble them. Set aside.
<br><br>
Make Dough
        <br><br>
3. To a mixing bowl add
        <br><br>
2 cups all-purpose flour (organic maida)
        <br>
¾ teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)
        <br>
¾ teaspoon salt
        <br>
¼ cup oil or ghee (4 tablespoons)
        <br><br>

4. Mix everything very well. Rub the flour in between your palms to incorporate the oil well for 3 to 4 minutes. After this step the flour should resemble breadcrumbs. Press down a handful of this flour in your palm, it should form or hold the shape. It should not crumble meaning oil is well incorporated. Check video.

<br><br>
5. Add 4 tablespoons water and begin to form a dough ball adding more water as needed. I added about 4+ 2 tablespoons water in total.
<br><br>
6. Dough has to be firm, stiff and not sticky. Cover and rest for 25 to 30 mins.
<br><br>
Make Potato Stuffing
        <br><br>
7. Heat 1 tablespoon oil or ghee in a pan. Next add ¾ teaspoon cumin seeds.
<br><br>

8. When the seeds begin to splutter, add 1 tablespoon minced ginger and 1 to 2 chopped green chilies. Sauté for 30 to 60 seconds. Then add a pinch of hing. Optional – You can also add some chopped cashews and roast until golden.
<br><br>
9. Add the spice powders –
<br><br>
¾ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder (adjust to taste)
        <br>
½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
        <br>
¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala
        <br>
½ teaspoon cumin powder
        <br>
½ teaspoon amchur powder (dried mango powder) or chaat masala (adjust to taste)
        <br>
½ teaspoon fennel powder (optional, saunf powder)
        <br>
Sauté for 30 seconds and then add green peas. Sauté for 1 to 2 mins. Then add potatoes.
        <br><br>

10. Sauté the entire potato masala for 2 to 3 mins until potatoes blend well with spice powders. Add ¼ cup chopped coriander leaves. Taste test this and adjust salt if needed.
<br><br>
Set aside to cool. If you have not used amchur or chaat masala, then add lemon juice at this stage.

<br><br>
Make Samosa
        <br><br>
11. After 25 to 30 mins, knead the dough for another 3 to 4 mins. The dough has to be stiff yet and not soft. Divide the dough to 5 equal parts.
<br><br>
12. Oil the counter or the rolling board. Place the ball.
<br><br>
13. Roll it to an oval shaped even layer. Mine was 8.5 inches long and 6.5 inches wide. It has to be slightly thick and not too thin.
<br><br>

14. Cut it in the center to make 2 parts.
<br><br>
15. The roti shrinks back little due to the nature of all-purpose flour so I prefer to roll it gently again. If you feel the edges are too thick then roll a bit.
<br><br>
16. Apply water with your finger over the straight edge.

<br><br>
17. Join the edges to make a cone shape like you see in the picture. Stick the edges well. Stick the edge from inside the cone as well to secure. Check video. If you have a trouble sticking, make a paste of 2 tbsps flour and little water. Smear little paste to stick the edges.
<br><br>
18. Fill the cone with potato masala. Press down a bit with a tiny spoon.
<br><br>
19. Apply water on the edge.
<br><br>

20. Stick the edges to seal well. On one of the sides, make a pleat as shown in the image. I have shown an alternate but similar method in the video do take a look at it.
<br><br>
21. Bring the pleat to a side and stick it up. Make sure your samosa is sealed well. Pinch and Press down on the edges very well to seal them.
<br><br>
22. This will give you a perfectly standing samosa. Place them on a tray and cover to prevent drying. Just make 5 to 6 samosas first and then fry them. Make the rest of the samosas while you fry the first batch. This way the samosas will not dry up.
<br><br>

Fry Samosa
23. Heat a pan with oil for deep frying. The oil should be moderately hot and not very hot. When it is just getting hot, add a small portion of dough to the oil. It has to rise slowly & the oil must not be bubbling or sizzling a lot. You should see only tiny bubbles. This is the right temperature. (The dough should not come up immediately and turn golden.)
<br><br>
24. Gently slide as many samosas as you can to the oil (I fry 5 at one time). Fry them on a low flame, undisturbed for about 10 to 12 mins. When the crust becomes firm, increase the flame to medium. Turn them to the other side and fry until crispy and golden.
<br><br>
Helpful note: After you add them to the hot oil, you will see very tiny bubbles rising slowly, meaning the temperature is right. You should not be hearing any sizzling noise as it does with other fried snacks.
<br><br>
25. Don’t rush. They will take a lot of time to fry golden. Be patient and fry until golden & crisp. (check video). When the samosas turn golden, remove them to a steel colander or wire rack. For the next batch, reduce the heat completely to bring down the temperature and add them.
