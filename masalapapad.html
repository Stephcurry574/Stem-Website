    <p>4 Urad Papad
        <br>
1 Red onion - finely chopped
        <br>
1 Red tomato - finely chopped
        <br>
1 Tablespoon Cilantro or coriander leaves- finely chopped
        <br>
1 Tablespoon Chat Masala
        <br>
⅛ teaspoon red chili powder
        <br>
¼ cup thin sev
        <br>
1 teaspoon lemon or lime juice

<br>
        <br>
Instructions

Prep your veggies : Finely chop onion and cilantro leaves. Cut the tomatoes in half. Remove the core and seeds then finely chop them.

        <br>
        <br>
Roast the Papad : Slightly brush some oil on top of dry papad. Then pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. See the doneness after 30 seconds and add another 30 seconds if needed.
A properly roasted papad has small bumps on top and a good crispy crunch. You can do multiple papads at once in the microwave. Adjust the time accordingly. ( use only 30 seconds intervals to avoid burning the papads )
        <br>
        <br>
Tip: you can chop the veggies and roast the papad simultaneously to save time.
        <br>
        <br>
Layer it up : Lay the roasted papad on a flat surface ( you need to handle it gently to avoid it from breaking). Layer spoonful of chopped veggies and sev on top. Sprinkle red chili powder, lime or lemon juice and chat masala.</p>
