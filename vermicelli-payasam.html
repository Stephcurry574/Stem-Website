    <p class="h1">Samiya Payasam</p>
    <p>¾ cup semiya (thick vermicelli)
        <br>
½ cup sugar (adjust to taste)
        <br>
½ teaspoon green cardamom powder (elaichi) or few strands of saffron
        <br>
4 cups milk (1x – 3½ cups for instant pot)
        <br>
2 tablespoons ghee
        <br>
12 to 15 cashew nuts or as needed
        <br>
8 to 10 sweet raisins or as needed
        <br><br>

Instructions
        <br><br>

Firstly add half of the ghee to a heavy bottom pot and heat up.
        <br><br>

Add cashews and fry till golden.
        <br><br>

Then add sweet raisins and fry just until they plump up. Remove these to a plate and keep aside for garnish.
        <br><br>

Next add the rest of the ghee and add semiya to the same pan. Roast till slightly golden on a low to medium flame. (skip this step if using pre-roasted semiya)

How to make Semiya Payasam
        <br><br>

Pour milk to the pot. Let the milk boil on a low to medium flame.
        <br><br>


Boil till the vermicelli is fully soft cooked. Keep stirring to avoid burning.
        <br><br>

Add sugar. Cook for 3 to 5 mins on a low flame until the semiya payasam becomes thick.
        <br><br>

Add cardamom powder. Turn off when it reaches a thick pouring consistency. It will thicken further after cooling.
        <br><br>

Garnish semiya payasam with fried nuts and raisins. Serve hot or chilled as desired.
