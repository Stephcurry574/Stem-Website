8 Slices White bead
        <br>
1/2 Cup cashews
        <br>
For the Spiced Syrup
        <br>
1 ½ cups or 350 ml water
        <br>
1 ½ cups or 250 gms Sugar
        <br>
5 strands of saffron optional

Instructions
        <br><br>

To make the jamun:
        <br><br>
Take about 8 slices of bread and cut the crusts cut off. Blend them into a coarse powder.
        <br><br>
In another blender, blend cashews with some water into a very smooth cream. Sub with coconut cream if you don't have cashews.
        <br><br>
Pour the cashew (or coconut) cream onto the crumbs, and mix until you have a smooth, pliable dough that's a bit sticky.
        <br><br>
Divide into 18-20 equal-sized pieces and roll each into a ball (coat palms with oil to help smoothen the surface).
        <br><br>
Air fry at 200 C for 25 minutes (or deep fry) the balls until golden brown. Set aside.
        <br><br>
Sugar syrup:
        <br><br>
Place the sugar, water, cardamom and saffron in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer, and add lemon juice.
        <br><br>
Let it simmer for another five minutes then turn off the heat.
        <br><br>
Soak the iamuns in Sugar syrup.
        <br><br>
Pour the syrup over the air fried jamun balls when the syrup is still warm and let sit for at least 3 hours, so they soak up the syrup.
        <br><br>
Serve the gulab jamuns (warm of cold) with a drizzle of the syrup.</p>
