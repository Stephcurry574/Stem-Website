    <p>
        1. Add 1 cup aged basmati rice to a bowl and rinse well a few times until the water runs clear. Soak it for 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile rinse and chop vegetables & herbs. After 20 to 30 mins, drain the water from the basmati rice completely & keep aside.
<br><br>
You will see double the quantity of all ingredients in the pictures as I made 2x recipe.
<br><br>
2. Heat a pressure cooker with 1½ to 2 tablespoons oil or ghee. Add whole spices
<br><br>
1 bay leaf
        <br>
1 inch cinnamon
        <br>
3 green cardamom
        <br>
3 cloves
        <br>
½ teaspoon shahi jeera (or cumin seeds)
        <br>
1 star anise (optional, but recommended)
        <br>
1 strand mace (optional)
        <br>
little stone flower (optional)
        <br><br>
3. When the spices begin to crackle, add 1 sliced onion (½ cup) and 1 chopped green chili. On a medium heat, saute until the onions turn deep golden. Keep stirring often to fry evenly.
<br><br>

4. Next add 1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste. Saute this for 1 to 2 minutes or until the raw smell goes off.
<br><br>
5. Transfer 1 cup chopped mix veggies. Saute on a medium to high flame for 2 to 3 minutes. I have used potato, peas, onions, carrots, cauliflower and french beans.
<br><br>
You can also add soya chunks if you like. To add soya chunks, soak them in hot water until soft. Squeeze up the water. Rinse a few times and squeeze them completely. Then add here.

6. Next add the following
<br><br>
2 tablespoons mint leaves (pudina)
        <br>
2 tablespoons coriander leaves
        <br>
½ teaspoon red chilli powder
        <br>
1/8 teaspoon turmeric
        <br>
1/8 teaspoon salt
        <br>
¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala (or biryani masala powder)
        <br>
1 small finely chopped tomato (optional)
        <br>
3 tablespoons yogurt (curd or dahi).
        <br><br>

7. Mix and fry again for another 2 to 3 minutes on a slightly high flame until the tomatoes break down. Do not burn it. The mixture turns aromatic after frying. Regulate the flame to low and spread the veggies to a single even layer.

8. Add the drained rice. Spread it evenly to another layer.
<br><br>
Please note the amount of water mentioned here is for aged basmati rice. If you are using newly harvested basmati rice, you will require lesser water. For any kind of newly harvested rice, you will use the same amount of water as you use to cook the plain steamed rice.
<br><br>
9. Pour water to a separate bowl and add ¼ teaspoon salt. Mix and taste test the water. It has to be slightly salty. If needed add more salt. Bring the water to a boil. Pour the salted water around the edges of the pot or cooker. Level the rice. This method gives you layered vegetable biryani. (check video to understand). OR you can also just pour the water and mix everything and cook.
<br><br>
You will need 1¾ cups water for cooker, 2 cups for regular pot. Optional : You can also add a tbsp of ghee, sprinkle some fried onions and then 1 pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tbsps milk.
<br><br>

10. Cover the pot or pressure cooker with the lid.
        <br><br>
Pressure cooker – Cook on a medium high flame for one whistle.
        <br><br>
To cook in pot – Bring it to a rolling boil. Cover and cook on a low heat until all of the water is absorbed and the rice if cooked fully. Once done turn off and rest for 15 minutes.
<br><br>
11. When made in pressure cooker, I manually release the pressure with the help of a wooden spoon after 1 to 2 mins.When the pressure releases, open the lid. Lastly gently fluff up the vegetable biryani with a fork. Let it cool down a bit and then squeeze lemon juice if desired. Do not stir it vigorously otherwise biryani will turn mushy.
