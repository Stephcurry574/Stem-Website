    <p class="h1">Indo Chinese Chicken Fried Rice</p>
    <p>For the Rice
         <br> <br>
1 ¼ cup (~235 g) aged, long-grain basmati rice, washed thoroughly and soaked for 30-40 minutes, then drained – See Note 1 for using cooked rice
        <br>
7 cups (1.75 quarts) water
         <br>
1 tbsp sea salt
         <br>
1 tbsp neutral oil
         <br>
1 tsp distilled white vinegar, or lemon juice
         <br>
         <br>
For the Sauce
         <br>
1 ½-2 tsp oyster sauce
         <br>
1 tsp chili garlic sauce, (I use Desi Style – National or Mitchel’s brand)
         <br>
1/2 tsp all-purpose soy sauce
         <br>
1/4 tsp sesame oil
         <br>
         <br>

For the Egg
         <br>
1 egg
         <br>
1/8 tsp sea salt
         <br>
1/8 tsp black pepper
         <br> <br>
For the Stir-Fry:
         <br>
3 tbsp + 1 tsp neutral oil, such as avocado oil
         <br>
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped/crushed
         <br>
1/2 inch ginger, finely chopped/crushed
         <br>
6 oz (170 g) chicken breast, cut into 1/3-inch thick pieces – you want mini, bite-sized pieces
         <br>
1 tsp soy sauce
         <br>
1 tsp (3 g) chicken powder, (bouillon cube, crumbled to a powder) OR 2 tsp (9g) MSG (Ajinomoto)
         <br>
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
         <br>
1/4 tsp ground white pepper
         <br>
1/4 tsp sea salt
         <br>
1 ½ cups (90 g) green cabbage, thinly sliced into 1-2” long strips (may also use coleslaw mix)
         <br>
1/2 cup (65 g) frozen green peas, (measured frozen), thawed
         <br>
1/2 cup (70 g) one large carrot, peeled and diced into 1/4” cubes (may also use shredded)
         <br>
2 (25 g) green onions, stemmed and finely chopped/thinly sliced, reserve some green parts for garnish
         <br> <br>


Instructions
         <br> <br>
Prepare the rice (or use cooked – See Note 1): Place a medium pot over high heat and bring 7 cups (1.75 quarts) of water to a boil (cover to make this go faster). Add salt, oil, and vinegar/lemon juice and stir. Drain and add the rice. Once it comes to a boil again, boil for 10 minutes, until the rice is fully cooked and tender, but not mushy. (Unlike the rice in Biryani or Zarda which has a bite to it, this should be fully cooked, just not super tender to the point that it breaks during the stir-fry process.) Drain using a large colander, and fluff with a rice paddle to prevent clumping. (If you don’t have a large colander, spread it out on a tray). Set aside.
         <br> <br>
Prepare the Sauce: Place the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and mix together. Set aside.
         <br> <br>
Whisk egg: Place the egg in another small bowl and whisk with the salt and pepper.
         <br> <br>
Stir-Fry: Heat 1 tsp of the oil in a large nonstick wok or pan over medium heat. Stir it around to coat the bottom of the pan. Pour in the whisked egg and spread it out over the bottom of the work. Let the egg set for about 30 seconds, until the bottom is lightly golden on some parts. Use a large spatula to flip and cook the bottom side until fully set, about 10 more seconds. Remove and roughly cut into ½” by 1" thin strips. Set aside.

         <br> <br>

Add the remaining 3 tbsp oil in the same wok. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 10 seconds, until aromatic. Add the chicken pieces and increase the heat to high. Season with the soy sauce, chicken powder/MSG, black pepper, white pepper, and sea salt. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the chicken changes color from pink to white. Add the cabbage, peas, carrots, and green onions. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, until the vegetables are just tender but still vibrant and crunchy.
         <br> <br>
Add the cooked rice and remaining sauce. Using two rubber spatulas or rice paddles, lift and toss to distribute the rice, taking care not to break the rice grains. Toss until evenly mixed together, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Add the cooked eggs and remaining green onion and toss to combine. Serve hot alongside your fav Indo-Chinese main dish!</p>
