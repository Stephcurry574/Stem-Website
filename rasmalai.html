    <p class="h1">Rasmalai</p>
    <p>Make Rabri
        <br><br>
1. Making rabri. Pour 3 cups milk to a heavy bottom pot. Bring it to a boil on a medium flame. Add saffron/ kesar and keep stirring every few minutes to prevent burning.
<br><br>
2. Next pour sugar. I used organic sugar. You can use white sugar as well.

<br><br>
3. Adjust the flame as desired to suit your convenience. Do not use high flame milk may overflow the pot. Keep stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, moving aside the malai/cream that comes on top. Turn off when it gets condensed to half the quantity.
<br><br>
Chill half of this in the fridge. Keep the rest in the same pot.
<br><br>
Make Chenna
        <br><br>
4. While the rabri is getting done, bring 5 cups milk to a boil in another pot for making chenna/paneer. If you are using non-homogenized milk then take off the milk from the stove and allow to rest for 5 mins. Then add the vinegar.
<br><br>
If using homogenized milk, add the curd or lemon juice or vinegar once the milk comes to a boil.
<br><br>
5. Keep stirring until the milk curdles completely. If needed add more lemon juice or vinegar. Switch off the stove.
<br><br>

6. When you see it has curdled completely, immediately add ice cubes or ice cold water. This is very important to keep the chenna soft.
<br><br>
7. Drain it up in a thin clean muslin cloth.
<br><br>
8. Wrap up the paneer in the cloth bringing together all the edges. Put the cloth under running water, making sure the paneer is wrapped well in the cloth. Rinse it well under the running water to remove the smell of lemon or vinegar.
<br><br>
Tie up the paneer in the cloth. Squeeze off the excess water. Hang it up on a hook for 45 minutes to 1 hour for the whey to completely drain.
<br><br>

9. At this step you must have chenna that is just moist with no dripping water and not sticky. Knead it well until you get smooth, grain free and non-sticky chena. You must not knead to the extent that chenna begins to release grease or fats.
<br><br>

Make Rasmalai
        <br><br>
10. Divide it to 12 equal portions. Make balls and flatten them gently. You can also make rasgulla or chum chum. If you find the edges cracked up, gently smoothen them. Cover and set them aside.
<br><br>
11. Bring 3 1/2 cups water to a boil with 1 cup sugar. Use refined white sugar.
<br><br>

12. When the syrup begins to boil, add cardamom powder.
<br><br>
13. Next when the syrup begins to boil rapidly, add flattened discs of chenna. Cover immediately and cook on a moderately high flame for exactly 9 minutes.
<br><br>
14. The discs would have doubled in size. Keep it covered and take off the pot from the stove. Rest for atleast 20 mins.
<br><br>

15. Take out one by one and cool. Gently squeeze them in between your palms to remove the absorbed sugar syrup. You can also do it with a spatula and spoon.
<br><br>
16. Add them to the warm rabri.
<br><br>
17. Add chopped pistachios, almonds and cashews. You can also simmer for just one to 2 minutes on a low flame for the milk to be absorbed by the discs. Do not overcook at this stage, they may break.
<br><br>
Pour the chilled rabri to this and serve rasmalai chilled.
