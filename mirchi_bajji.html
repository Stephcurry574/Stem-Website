Stuffing for andhra cut mirch bajji
<br>
        <br>
Slit the green chillies vertically retaining their stem and deseed them . Don't cut them fully.

        <br>
        <br>
Stuff the chillies nicely and evenly such that the stufing is uniformly distributed throughout .Arrange them on a plate
<br>
        <br>
Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, mix besan,rice flour,jeera,haldi,chilly powder,soda and salt. Add water little by little. Mix such that no lumps are formed. Batter should be slightly thicker than dosa batter consistency.Add hot oil to the batter and mix well.

        <br>
When the oil is hot ,Dip stuffed chilli into the batter and drop carefully in to hot oil.
        <br>

Cook both sides until golden brown and crisp .Once done transfer the bajjis on an absorbent paper to drain excess oil.
If you want you can stop at this stage and relish your stuffed mirchi bajji hot garnished with onion , coriander etc. !! But to get actual andhra cut mirchi bajji taste , I recommend to control your craving and proceed to next step ....
Cut each of fried chillis into 1 inch long pieces.

Deep-fry them again in medium hot oil until they turn crispy .Drain them again on paper towels.
